### ✨ Introduction
Dear {name},

You’ve walked through lifetimes of conditioning—stories that asked you to dim your light. This season, your soul whispers: *no more hiding.* What follows is not prophecy—it’s remembrance.

---

### 🔢 Life Path {life_path}: {lp_title}
{lp_body}

---

### 🔠 Expression Number {expression}
{expression_meanings.get(expression, "")}

---

### 💓 Soul Urge Number {soul_urge}
{soul_urge_meanings.get(soul_urge, "")}

---

### 🌀 Personality Number {personality}
{personality_meanings.get(personality, "")}

---

### 🌑 Shadow Work Invitations
1) Where am I mistaking control for safety?
2) Which emotions am I ready to express instead of suppress?
3) What belief about my voice/power is ready to be released?

---

### 🌕 Ritual Practice (Waxing Moon)
Write your name on a slip of paper. Speak aloud: *“I reclaim my power, my voice, my divine authority.”* Burn safely and let the smoke rise like your new beginning.

---

### 🌟 Closing Affirmation
*“I trust my cosmic blueprint. I lead with courage, create with love, and remember that I am both human and divine.”*

Trust your cosmic blueprint. You were made for this. 🌙
